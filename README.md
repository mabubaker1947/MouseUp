# MouseUp
A .Net Fraework application that actually is a very helpfull tool to overule the organizational idle auto lock policies for your computer.

Recently, I've been facing a very frustrating issue in my new role where operating system level organizational group policies locks your machine automatically if machine is idle for few minutes. It locks even if you are reading an article or thinking for few minutes about how to approach a certain problem you are facing fro the client, the PC locks itself and you either have to keep typing some text or keep moving your mice to let the 5 minutes counter know that you are present on your seat and not enjoying your vape out of the office downstairs or waiting for your turn for a fantastic coffee cup in the kitchen area :p .

How to Run:
Just copy and run this exe /bin/Debug/MouseUpConsoleApp.exe file and pin it to your desktop and run every morning when you start your machine. Its set for 04:30 minutes as my auto lock time was 5 minutes. Feel free to adjust it by yourself.

Caution:
Although, the automatic locking is sole for the security purposes and everyone should follow and abide the organizational policies. However, this code is for personal use only, use it on your own risk. The sole purpose of this micro application is to stop an auto lock for your machine every 2-3 minutes when you go idle. Furthermore, its the responsibililty of users that your machine is locked all the times when leaving your seat as this application won't let the OS lock itself ever. If you find this usefull donot forget to say Thanks. :)
